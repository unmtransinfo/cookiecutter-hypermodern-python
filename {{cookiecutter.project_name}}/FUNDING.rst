This package was funded by
`NIH Grant 1U24 CA224370-01 <https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/9461406>`_
from the Common Fund, Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health.

*Overview:* 
KMC grant at UNM is led by Dr. Tudor Oprea and includes collaborations with 
Dr. Lars Juhl Jensen’s lab at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein
Research and at EMBL-EBI with Dr. Andrew Leach
as their Group Lead. Work from UNM includes the development of TCRD, the main 
database supporting Pharos, and appropriate visualization tools, such as TINx. 
Work by Dr. Oprea’s group include evaluation of the data collated into TCRD and 
led to the categorization of target proteins based on knowledge levels, Target 
Development Levels (TDL): Tdark are targets with least knowledge. Next level of 
development are Tbio, proteins with further annotation of function or biological
process, including confirmed OMIM phenotypes. With the discovery of protein interacting
with a drug or compound, these proteins are classified as Tchem if these compound
activities satisfy activity thresholds set based on protein biological class. 
Further annotation via DrugCentral regarding the mechanism of action for approved
drugs elevates the target into the TDL of Tclin, i.e., protein with highest attained
annotation.
